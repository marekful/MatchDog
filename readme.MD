MatchDog is a [FIBS](http://fibs.com) bot. It can invite and accept invitations 
from other players or bots on FIBS and play matches with them. 
It uses the [gnubg](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/) backgammon 
evaluation engine as backend.

Bots are allowed on FIBS but if you want to run one, 
the best is to check with the site administrator. 
If you abuse FIBS, you will be banned.

***FEATURES***

* several preconfigured users can be stored
* run MatchDog in multiple instances

    - automatically invite preferred players
    - automatically invite players when they log in if there is a saved match
    - automatically join an invitation for a saved match
    - automatically join an invitation
      (if this is true, then opponent experience
      and reputation is considered before joining)

  the following must be true to accept an invitation:
  `[match length] < [opponent experience] / [opponent experience divider]`

***REQUIREMENTS***

**OS:**
However MatchDogServer is written completely in Java and is a console program (without GUI),
it has only been tested in a bash shell of a Debain Linux box. It will probably run in other
Linux distributions and it will most likekly NOT run in MS Windows (cmd.exe).

**Java:**
I used the 1.6 update 3 release of the JDK to write and test the program.
It will probably also work with any 1.5 release of JRE but has not been tested with any earlier release.

**GNU Backgammon:**
In order to successfully run the program you should be able to run gnubg.
MatchDogServer will run the gnubg binary with `-q -t` options (silent, no gui). Give
full path to the binary in `config/matchdog.prefs` (see matchdog.prefs.sample).

MatchDogServer should be able to open and also to connect
to a socket on the localhost on the port number specified
in `config/matchdog.prefs`.

MatchDog has been tested with gnubg 1.04.000 and 1.05.002. Since there were changes
to the external interface since, it's not guaranteed to work with versions above.

**FIBS:**
MatchDog's FIBS player must have `set boardstyle: 3` and use the following `toggle` settings
to work correctly with MatchDog:
```allowpip        YES
autoboard       YES
autodouble      NO
automove        NO
bell            NO
crawford        YES
double          NO
greedy          NO
moreboards      YES
moves           NO
notify          YES
ratings         YES
ready           YES
report          YES
silent          NO
telnet          YES
wrap            NO
```



***SETUP***

NOTE! 
Specify global parameters in `config/matchdog.prefs` 
and at least one user `config/[n].pprefs` before running. 

See comments `config/0.pprefs.sample`

Also, for the 'show log' function to work, the first five
variables in the included `ftpupload.sh` file need to be set.

***COMPILE***

One way to compile the sources on a Linux a system is to
 change directory to `[PROJECT_ROOT]/bin` 
 (or create it if necessary) and issue the following
 three commands in a bash shell (assuming that the java
 binaries are on the path):

`javac -d .  ../src/jcons/src/com/meyling/console/*.java`

`javac -d .  ../src/etc/TorExitNodeChecker.java`

`javac -d .  ../src/matchdog/*.java`

Make sure files compile without errors. Ignore 'Notes' from jcons.


***USAGE***

On a Linux a system, change directory to `[PROJECT_ROOT]/bin`  where the compiled java .class
files are located and issue the following command in a bash shell
(assuming that the java binaries are on the path):

`java matchdog/MatchDogServer N [0|1]`

where `N` is the index number of the player preferences object
in the player map.

There must be at least one user preferences object instantiated
and put in the players map at index 0.

If no command line parameter is given or not a number is given
or there is no user preferences object at that index of the
map, the default user at index 0 is used.

By default, MatchDog prints an awful lot of information about what's going on to stdout 
with console escape sequences to colour text and background to differentiate 
where the information came from and also accepts user input from stdin to control 
various things in the server while it's running, mostly for debugging purposes. 
By passing 0 as a second command line argument, stdin and stdout are not attached 
and MatchDog runs silently.

When `i_listenerport` in the user pprefs file is set to a valid port number,
MatchDog will expose that port on the host machine if it can
accept connections on it. This allows for remote monitoring of the bot.


**Example gnubg initialisation command sequence**

`set threads 8` # number of cpu cores this instance will use

`set eval sameasanalysis off`

`set evaluation chequer eval plies 3`

`set evaluation cubedecision eval plies 3`

`set evaluation movefilter 1 0 0 16 0.320`

`set evaluation movefilter 2 0 0 16 0.320`

`set evaluation movefilter 3 0 0 16 0.320`

`set evaluation movefilter 3 2 0 4 0.080`

`set evaluation movefilter 4 0 0 16 0.320`

`set evaluation movefilter 4 2 0 4 0.080`

`external localhost:xxxx` # this causes gnubg to expose the external interface and will accept user input via the API
